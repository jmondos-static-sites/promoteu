  <h2 class="left">Who We Are</h2>
  <p class="right">We are a student-run promotions company operating out of Babson College in Wellesley, MA. We are part of an innovative class called Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship. Since we are all students, we felt we had a distinct idea of what could be modified in the college-marketing process. This led us to offer our ideas for promotional products to all businesses, area schools, and organizations. Hence our choice to create the promotion company, PromoteU.</p>

  <h2 class="left">What We Offer</h2>
  <p class="right">What we found was missing from typical promotions was innovation. It is our mission to deliver innovative products, and only those in which young professionals and students, those with the highest standards for technology, would be interested in. We conducted elaborate market research on both students and work-force professionals via surveys, focus groups, and interviews and we think you’ll love which products we’ve come up with.</p>
